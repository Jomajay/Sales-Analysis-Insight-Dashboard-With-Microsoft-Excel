# Sales-Analysis-Insight-Dashboard-With-Microsoft-Excel
--------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview
The Sales Insights Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool created using Microsoft Excel. It is designed to offer an in-depth visualization of sales data across various segments, products, and time periods. This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly grasp key metrics and trends, facilitating informed and strategic decision-making processes.

The Sales Insights Dashboard is an Excel tool that visualizes key sales metrics through interactive charts, including Product vs. Profit, Sales Per Segment, Monthly Sales Trend, and Total Units Sold Per Segment. Filters for country, discount band, and year help stakeholders identify trends and make data-driven decisions.
The workbook "Sales Analysis Insights" consists of four spreadsheets: "Original Data," "Data," "Pivot Table," and "Dashboard." Below is the detailed readme for each spreadsheet, including methods used for data cleaning.

## Sales Analysis Insights

### Spreadsheet: Original Data
#### Description:
The "Original Data" sheet contains raw sales data collected from various sources. This data is unprocessed and may include inconsistencies or errors that must be addressed before analysis.

#### Data Cleaning Methods:
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed any duplicate rows to ensure that each sales transaction is unique.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for missing values in essential columns such as Product, Segment, and Sales. Imputed missing values where appropriate or removed incomplete rows.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensured consistency in date formats, numerical values, and text fields. For example, converted all date entries to a uniform format and ensured numerical fields like Sales and Profit were correctly formatted.
4. **Correcting Errors**: Identified and corrected any obvious data entry errors, such as incorrect product names or segment classifications.

### Spreadsheet: Data
#### Description:
The "Data" sheet contains cleaned and processed sales data, ready for analysis. This sheet is derived from the "Original Data" sheet after applying data cleaning methods.

#### Data Cleaning Methods:
1. **Normalization**: Standardized data entries to ensure uniformity across the dataset. This includes ensuring consistent naming conventions for products and segments.
2. **Filtering**: Removed irrelevant or outlier data that could skew the analysis. For example, sales records with zero or negative values were filtered out.
3. **Transformation**: Converted categorical data into appropriate formats for analysis. For instance, segment names were standardized, and date fields were split into Year, Month, and Day for easier analysis.
4. **Aggregation**: Summarized sales data where necessary, such as calculating total sales and profit by product and segment.


## Data Cleaning Summary:
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensured uniqueness of sales transactions.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed incomplete data entries.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensured consistency in data representation.
4. **Correcting Errors**: Fixed obvious data entry mistakes.
5. **Normalization**: Standardized data entries for uniformity.
6. **Filtering**: Removed irrelevant or outlier data.
7. **Transformation**: Converted data into appropriate formats for analysis.
8. **Aggregation**: Summarized data for easier analysis and visualization.

This comprehensive approach to data cleaning and preparation ensures that the sales data is accurate, consistent, and ready for in-depth analysis and visualization.

### Spreadsheet: Pivot Table
#### Description:
The "Pivot Table" sheet contains various pivot tables created from the cleaned data. These tables provide a summarized view of the sales data, breaking it down by different dimensions such as product, segment, and time period.

#### Key Features:
1. **Sales by Product**: A pivot table showing total sales and profit for each product.
2. **Sales by Segment**: A pivot table summarizing sales and profit across different market segments.
3. **Monthly Sales Trend**: A pivot table displaying sales trends over each month, enabling analysis of seasonal patterns.
4. **Segment-wise Product Performance**: A pivot table detailing the performance of each product within different segments.
